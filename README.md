Use NuxtJS to build a simple two page movie info application.

- We should be able to search for a movie name, and click on a movie card to see some basic details.
- The application needs to be in universal mode, and data should be fetched server side.
- A test should be written for the card component in JestJs
- Use PostCSS for all styling, and flexbox for any grid related needs
- We should be able to statically generate this application
- We are looking for a mobile first design
